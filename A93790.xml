            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Iſraelites being ſore pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon of the three yeeres drought, and the famine enſuing upon it under <hi>Ahab,</hi> had yet a promiſing meſſage of raine, and plentie ſent to them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, before they ſought unto the God of heaven for it: It ſeemes their Idolatries, and Apoſtaſies were growne ſo connaturall unto them that they were not ſenſible of their miſcarriages. I wiſh that it were not ſo in <hi>England.</hi> The Sword hath been feeding upon fleſh, and glutting it ſelfe with
<pb facs="tcp:112367:3"/>blood for a long time: and yet there is cauſe to complaine with <hi>Salvian, Plectimur à Deo, nec flectimur tamen; corripimur, ſed non corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimur.</hi> Though the Lord hath made us ſicke in ſmiting, yet few there are that repent of their wickedneſſe, ſaying, what have I done? but every one ruſheth into ſin, as the Horſe ruſheth into the battell. <hi>Ier. 8.6.</hi> And no marvell, for unleſſe the Lord give a minde as well as means, ſight as well as light, and irradiate the Organ as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Object, we cannot but erre: neither is our naturall blindneſſe, the only cauſe hereof; but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan alſo puts his black hand before our eyes, that we may not ſee the dangerous paths wherein we walke. The world alſo by laying forth her two faire breaſts, of profit and pleaſure, hath caſt down many wounded, yea many ſtrong men have been ſlaine by her, as it is ſaid of the whoriſh woman, <hi>Prov. 7.26.</hi> Theſe are the principall cauſes (I conceive) why ſo many halters in Religion are to be found among us, after ſo long enjoyment of ſo cleare light, and ſo many ſmart rods, wherewith the Lord hath chaſtened us. How often have we been taught from God, that we muſt ſerve him
<pb facs="tcp:112367:3"/>truly, and totally, without halting, or halving? and yet how many thouſands are in this Kingdome which ſtill continue in their ſins, and even hate to be reformed? The multitudes of carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, formall Proteſtants, combining, and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Papiſts, to whom Satan hath lent his ſeven heads to plot, his ten hornes to puſh at the Saints of God, doe ſufficiently demonſtrate the truth hereof. But our comfort is that the Lord will diſappoint the craftie in their deviſes, ſo that their hands cannot performe their works, <hi>Iob. 5.12.</hi> The Lord will raiſe up Carpenters to cut off thoſe hornes (as you were learnedly, reaſonably, and plentifully inſtructed in the morning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;) And our hope is, that as the Lord hath (in great mercy both to our Church, and State) mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly preſerved your perſons, ſupported your ſpirits, and carryed you on thus farre in repairing our breaches, ſo he that hath begun this great worke by you, will in his own gracious time perfect the ſame, whereby the puritie of Gods ordinances being ſetled among us, we may be freed from halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and halving in Religion. And how ever though in the mean time you cannot be wholly free
<pb facs="tcp:112367:4"/>from the aſperſions of black mouthed inſtruments of Satan, who by their manifold calumnies, and reproaches ſeeke to retard the worke of God: yet I doubt not but you will remember what was the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ſaying af that holy Martyr Maſter <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> Doe well, and heare ill, is written upon heaven gates.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow was the time when the ſpirituall eſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſo exceedingly corrupted, that it required a ſpeedy, and thorough reformation, and the ſpirit of an <hi>Elijah</hi> to be imployed therein. For the ten Tribes had moſt grievouſly provoked the moſt High by their abominable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112367:5"/>Idolatries, and (which was a great aggravation of their iniquitie) they added unto their ſinne, impenitencie: and their impenitencie was not a little heightned by their long continuance therein, notwithſtanding all the meanes which the Lord had uſed for their reformation, who had inſtructed them by his faithfull meſſengers, and corrected them with the ſmart rod of a three yeeres drought; indeavouring by an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall Judgement, to cure an Epidemicall ſin; of which puniſhment <hi>Elijah</hi> had propheſied at the firſt verſe of the precedent Chapter, which was accordingly fulfilled, as appeareth in the enſuing part of the ſame. But the Lord (in the midſt of judgement remembring mercy) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to remove that ſore rod, acquaints <hi>Elijah</hi> with his purpoſe, and withall commands him to ſhew himſelfe unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> as you may read at the firſt verſe of this eighteenth Chapter. Whereupon the Prophet undertakes the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. And in the way meets <hi>Obadiah, verſ.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Obadiah</hi> was governour of <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, and one that feared the Lord greatly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. A rare thing to finde ſo godly a man in ſuch a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Family. <hi>Elijah</hi> wils <hi>Obadiah</hi> to tell his Lord <hi>Ahab</hi> that <hi>Elijah</hi> would ſpeake with him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Obadiah</hi> refuſeth to deliver the meſſage, and gives ſeverall reaſons for the juſtification of his deniall, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Elijah</hi> had diſcovered his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112367:5"/>reſolution of ſhewing himſelfe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Obadiah</hi> went to meet <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> went to meet <hi>Elijah,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>Ahab</hi> had no ſooner ſet his eye upon <hi>Elijah</hi> but hee chargeth the good Prophet with the troubles of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 17.</p>
            <p>It hath ever been the property of wicked men to accuſe the ſervants of God, as the cauſes of publique calamities. Thus the Heathens dealt with the Chriſtians in the Primitive times: If there was either the plague, or the ſword, or the famine, or the like judgements upon the Land, then <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones,</hi> they haled the poore Chriſtians to the Lions to be tormented. But obſerve the Prophets anſwer, he deales faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the King, and by way of retortion chargeth the troubles of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon him, &amp; upon his Fathers houſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. And withall requires him to ſummon all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> with the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> foure hundred, and fifty, together with the foure hundred Prophets of the Groves, which did eat at <hi>Iezabels</hi> table, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. This was done accordingly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. The people being thus convened in a full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the Prophet ſpeaketh unto them in the words of my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> Elijah <hi>came unto all the people, and ſaid: How long halt ye betweene two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him: and the people anſwered him not a word.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112367:6"/>
            <p>Obſerve the Prophets courage: he feared neither <hi>Ahabs</hi> greatneſſe, nor the peoples num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: but he came unto all the people, and ſaid, <hi>How long halt ye, &amp;c.</hi> Why are you thus irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and inconſtant? Why doe ye fluctuate and waver thus? The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word that is here tranſlated <hi>halt,</hi> ſignifieth (as ſome obſerve) a lameneſſe on both feet, and it is the ſame that is uſed 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.4. to expreſſe <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> his lameneſſe, who was lame on both feet. <hi>Iacob</hi> had but one ſide lame, and another word is uſed to ſignifie his lameneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.31. Theſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters were lame on both feet. Hereunto the <hi>Septuagint</hi> agreeth. They had never a good foot, they divided betweene God, and <hi>Baal,</hi> they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neither cordially. They halted betweene two opinions, as it is expreſſed in the Text, or between two thoughts, as it may be read; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the falſe Prophets had corrupted their judgements by their falſe Doctrine. Error in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion cauſeth halting in practiſe. It is evident that they halted practically. <hi>How long halt ye?</hi> they had for a long time continued in their halting, which made their ſinne the greater, and the cure the more difficult. <hi>Fruſtra medicina pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur, &amp;c. If the Lord be God.</hi> The word <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which is here tranſlated [Lord] ſignifies (as Divines obſerve) three things, which are proper onely to the Divine Eſſence.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Gods eternall, immutable, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent being.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his giving of being to the creature, and therefore the name <hi>(Iehovah)</hi> is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned till the Creation was perfect, and then we reade <hi>Iehovah Elohim,</hi> Gen. 2.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this name <hi>(Iehovah)</hi> ſignifieth Gods faithfull giving of being unto his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and in this ſenſe God ſaith, that his name <hi>Iehovah</hi> was not knowne to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> Exod. 6.3. that is, they found not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall ſignificancy of it in the performance of the promiſe. If <hi>Iehovah</hi> be God, <hi>follow</hi> him, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſerve him, worſhip him. But if <hi>Baal,</hi> then follow him. <hi>Baal</hi> ſignifies a Lord or Patrone; the Heathens called the Sunne by that name, which is the King or chiefe of the Planets. The <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians</hi> worſhipped the Sunne under the name of <hi>Baal-ſamen,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Iupiter Olympicus,</hi> which they called the Lord of heaven; as they tearmed the Moon the Queen of heaven, which was the <hi>Diana</hi> ſo much magnified by the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Idolaters. Some take <hi>Moloc,</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi> to be one, and the ſame Idol, comparing <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.5. with <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.35. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> in deteſtation of this Idol calleth him Shame: They went to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-Peor</hi> and ſeparated themſelves to that Shame, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 9.10. and the Greek Interpreters tranſlate <hi>Baal,</hi> Shame, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baal-Peor</hi> (in the judgement of many) is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112367:7"/>thought to be that obſcoen Idol upon which the Heathens ſo much doted. Indeed corporall, and ſpirituall whoredome are almoſt inſeparable companions; the Scripture notes a like violence, and inſatiableneſſe, in the purſuit of both. They were all like fed horſes, every one neighing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his neighbours wife, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.8. And they were mad upon their Idols, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.38. Some are of opinion that <hi>Solomon</hi> in his booke of <hi>Proverbs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh ſpirituall, as well as corporall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: poſſibly the Prophets that did eate at <hi>Iezebels</hi> table were as adulterous, as idolatrous. This <hi>Iezebel</hi> was the daughter of <hi>Eth-Baal</hi> King of the <hi>Zidonians,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.31. And it is more then probable that by her counſel her husband ſerved <hi>Baal,</hi> and cauſed an Altar to be reared up unto him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.31.32. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.25. And herein <hi>Ahab</hi> exceeded <hi>Ieroboam</hi> who ſet up the Calves in <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28.29. This wicked, whoriſh, painting <hi>Iezebel</hi> cauſed King <hi>Ahab</hi> (who was the too uxorious husband of a moſt imperious wife) to murder his good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Naboth</hi> the <hi>Iezreelite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet in the words of my Text ſeemes to reaſon thus. If <hi>Iehovah</hi> be an eternall, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and independent being; if he give being to every creature, and to his word, and promiſes, keeping covenant with his people for ever; then ſerve him: But if <hi>Baal</hi> be your Creator, if he can preſerve you, if he can give you food, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112367:7"/>raine, &amp;c. then ſerve him. <hi>And the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him not a word.</hi> Whether they were convinced by the Prophets ſpeech that <hi>Iehovah</hi> was the true God, but were afraid to confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould offend <hi>Ahab</hi> much, and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi> more: or whether they waited for ſome miraculous, and viſible diſcovery of the true God, having experience of the Prophets preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie with God, and in the mean time thought it convenient to ſuſpend their confeſſion. For when they ſaw the fire deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and conſume the ſacrifice, then they brake out into an open acknowledgement, and ſaid, The Lord he is the God, The Lord he is the God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.38.39. Or whether they were ſo aſtoniſhed with the Prophets Dilemma, that they knew not what to anſwer; I determine not.</p>
            <p>In the Prophets ſpeech we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>Firſt, his complaint: Secondly, his counſell. His complaint in theſe words, <hi>How long halt ye betweene two opinions?</hi> His counſell in theſe, <hi>If the Lord be God, then follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The complaint is reprehenſory: it is a chiding complaint, he rebukes them ſharpely for their halting in Religion: The acrimony, or tartneſſe of the reproofe appeareth by the interrogative expreſſion of it, and he aggravateth their ſinne by their long continuance therein: <hi>How long

As the <hi>Neuter</hi> is abominable, ſo the halting <hi>Vterque</hi> is not to be indured, that divideth betweene God, and <hi>Baal:</hi> God will not allow of any dividing either in the Object, or <hi>Terminus</hi> of worſhip: as he will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; ſo he will be worſhipped ſolely. Thou ſhalt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112367:8"/>have no other Gods but me. The Lord is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, and will indure no corrivall. Jealouſie is the rage of a man, and he will not ſpare in the day of his wrath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.34.35. God lookes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divided worſhip, as no worſhip. It is ſaid of thoſe Idolaters ſpoken of, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. in one <hi>verſ.</hi> that they feared God, and worſhipped their Idols: and in the <hi>verſ.</hi> immediately following, That they feared not God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.33.34. and 1 <hi>Zeph.</hi> 5. The Lord ſeverely threatned ſuch as did ſweare by the Lord, and by <hi>Malcham.</hi> As the Lord cannot indure dividing in the <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of worſhip, ſo he hates dividing in the rule of worſhip, and the worſhip it ſelfe. The halting <hi>Vterque</hi> that makes the Scripture a partiall rule of worſhip, that worſhippeth God partly after the preſcript of the word, and partly according to the Dictates of his owne carnall reaſon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe any acceptable ſervice to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.

This corrupt mingling in Gods worſhip was prohibited, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.19.</p>
            <p>As God will be worſhipped ſolely, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo he will be worſhipped conſtantly: as he hates a <hi>Neuter,</hi> and <hi>Vterque,</hi> ſo he cannot indure a Waverer. The Lord commands us to hold faſt

Inconſtancy in Religion is a very evill thing, whether you conſider the ſinne of it, or the puniſhment which is due to it. It cometh from evill, it tends to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. It cometh from evill, as from the generall fountaine of all actuall ſinnes; originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo particularly from that evill heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe whereby we depart from the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. It tends to evill both in reſpect of ſinne, and puniſhment. It is diſhonourable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. It is a high impeachment of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attributes. It wrongs God in his wiſedome, juſtice, mercy, power, goodneſſe, faithfulneſſe, as if God were not worthy of our firmeſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and moſt conſtant adherence; in a word, of our poore All; or, as if he were either unable, or unwilling to revenge himſelfe upon incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant halters.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Get your hearts warmed with the love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,
which the Apoſtle calleth a conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. For as reward hath an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, and puniſhment an impulſive: ſo love hath a compulſive facultie. Reward draws: pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment drives: but love is moſt efficacious in the perſwading of us unto the diſcharge of our dutie.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:112367:13"/>
            <p>Laſtly, fixe your faith upon the promiſes, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Moſes</hi> his opticks, eye him that is inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. And eye the threats alſo: Looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that good which God promiſeth, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good, and upon the evill which he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as the greateſt evill.</p>
            <p>And (Honorable Patriots) I beſeech you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the word of exhortation: let it be your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care to follow God, in your perſonall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the promoting of a nationall Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; Follow him perſonally. It will be your greateſt honour to be his ſervants: You are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high in your civill priviledges, but there is a priviledge of which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely out-ſhines all earthly ſplendour; It is the priviledge of our ſpirituall Adoption. To as many as received him, he gave the power or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to become the ſons of God: even to thoſe that beleeve on his name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. For there is a Nobilitie which is divine, and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, whereof God is the top of the kin, and Religion, the Root, in regard of which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nobility is but a meere ſhadow: It would be a ſad thing (Noble Senatours) if after the hearing of ſo many ſoule ſearching Sermons out of this place, if after ſo much good done by you unto the Kingdome in the worke of Reformation, any of you ſhould remaine in an unregenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if any of you ſhould be like the builders of the Arke, who provided for the ſafetie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112367:13"/>but could not ſave themſelves from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing by the Deluge. Conſider I beſeech you (worthy Chriſtians) that the Vowes of God are upon you, you have abjured Neutralitie in your late Solemne Covenant, farre be it from any of you to glory in a luke-warme indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as if it were a peece of ſingular policy. They who thus glory in their ſhame, ſhall one day be aſhamed of this their glory. You have with your tongues renounced this Neutralitie, and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency as deteſtable. Follow the Lord in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a Nationall Reformation. You have an admirable patterne, the zealous Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> a man of ſuch tranſcendent zeale, that toheighten the expreſſion thereof, ſome have legendred of him, that when he drew his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſts, he was ſeene to ſucke in fire: I wiſh from my ſoule that a double portion of his ſpirit, may be given unto you, that you may act in his power, and ſpirit: <hi>Elijah</hi> oppoſed Idolatry and oppreſſion, ſo doe ye, down with <hi>Baals</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, down with <hi>Baals</hi> prieſts: doe not (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) conſent unto a toleration of <hi>Baals</hi> worſhip in this Kingdom upon any politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whatſoever; I have heard that you have already Voted that you will never give your conſent to the toleration of the Romiſh Maſſe in this Kingdom. I will take up the words of <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. O Lord God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> our Father, keepe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112367:14"/>this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of your hearts. Follow God (I beſeech you) in the ſpeedy, and impartiall execution of Juſtice: Give me leave (I beſeech you) to be your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Remembrancer: The mouthes of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are opened againſt you, the hearts of your true friends are grieved, That ſo many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents are in priſon, and yet but very few of them brought to their triall: I know that your occaſions are many, and preſſing, but I beſeech you lay hold upon the next opportunitie for the doing of it. Remember your late Covenant: When <hi>Elijah</hi> had done execution upon <hi>Baals</hi> prieſts; there was raine enough, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. Who knoweth how ſoone the Lord may bleſſe us with an holy peace, and bleſſed Reformation, if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were more fully executed? Let us follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the Morning, and he ſhall come unto us as the latter, and former raine, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. Twice in the yeere there fell ſtore of raine in Iſrael, in the beginning of the yeere about <hi>September,</hi> or <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and halfe a yeere after. The firſt raine fell after the ſowing of their corne, that it might take rooting in the earth: the latter raine was a little before the harveſt, that the eare might be full. We have had the former raine in the calling of this Parliament, we hope that the Lord will give us the latter raine alſo in the continuance of his bleſſing upon it in perfecting the worke of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112367:14"/>Reformation. God hath raiſed you up to be the repairers of the breaches, conſider (I beſeech you) that from the firſt ſervice in the Temple when it was built, and the time of <hi>Elijahs</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was about an hundred yeers: and from the Reformation in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt his dayes untill this preſent is much about the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time: Is not this the very time for which God hath reſerved, and for which he hath ſo admirably prepared you? Make the word of God your Rule in the Reformation of Religion: Shortly (I hope) a plat-forme of worſhip, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and government, will be preſented unto you, by thoſe whom you have employed for that purpoſe. I beſeech you bring all unto the Touch-ſtone of the word. Beleeve it (Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies) that Forme of Government will be beſt for the State, which is moſt agreeable unto the word: It hath been often ſaid by the Biſhops of the Government of the Reformed Churches (and they did commonly inſtance in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) that it was no friend to Monarchy. But I am ſure that Prelacy is no enemy unto Tyranny. The Lord guide you in the managing hereof, that what you ſhall do herein, may tend unto the glory of God, and the good and peace of his CHURCH.</p>
